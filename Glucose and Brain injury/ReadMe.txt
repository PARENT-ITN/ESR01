The scripts contained in this directory are part of the processing of data of continuous glucose measurements (CGM).
The data is not possible to be public since there is not the proper license for this.
Thus the scripts are the set of the processing functions of the CGM data.

If someone wants to use the scripts and apply the methods to their data he/she should have in mind that proper paths should be used and check for the column names as well.
